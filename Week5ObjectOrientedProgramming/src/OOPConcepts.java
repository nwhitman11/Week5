		 * Object Oriented Programming (OOP)
		 * 		DVD player
		 * 			- properties : things that define it
		 * 				- height
		 * 				- weight
		 * 				- width
		 * 				- color
		 * Functionality: things it can do
		 * 	- play
		 * 	- fast forward
		 * 	- rewind
		 * 	- pause
		 * 
		 * DVD
		 * 	Properties:
		 * 		Movie Length
		 * 		Image
		 * 		Size

		 * 
		 * Four Pillars of OOP:
		 * 	1. Abstraction
		 * 		- the set of essential characteristics of an object.  Only the most fundamental properties. (Triangle = 3 sides)
		 * 	2. Encapsulation
		 * 		-  Hiding the inner workings of a code so that it's not easily changed.  Protects the DNA of the code.
		 * 	3.  Inheritance
		 * 		-  Allows to objects/classes t inherit from parent classes
		 * 	4.  Polymorphism
		 * 		-  Something can take different forms.
		 * 			ex: Animals communicate  differently
		 * 					communicate
		 * 						bark, growl, meow, yell
		 * 
		 * Class: How we structure our code in OOP
		 * 	Class is like a blueprint
		 * 	Object is actual product developed from the blueprint
		 * An Object is an Instance of a Class
		 * 		Class: House
